                <p class="text-2xl font-medium pr-14">Workouts and exercises are structured physical activities designed to improve strength, endurance, flexibility, and overall fitness. They can range from aerobic exercises like running and cycling to strength training, yoga, or high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Regular exercise enhances cardiovascular health, supports weight management, and boosts mental well-being. Different types of exercises target various muscle groups and fitness goals, ensuring a balanced approach to health.</p>

                <p class="text-2xl font-medium pr-14">BMI (Body Mass Index) is commonly used as a screening tool to categorize individuals based on their weight relative to height, helping to assess whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. It provides a quick estimate of potential health risks associated with being over or underweight, though it doesn't account for factors like muscle mass or fat distribution.</p>

                <p class="text-2xl font-medium pr-14">Calories provide the energy our bodies need to perform essential functions such as breathing, digestion, and physical activity. They come from the food we eat, including carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Tracking calorie intake is important for achieving and maintaining specific health goals like weight loss or muscle gain. Balancing calories consumed with calories burned helps regulate body weight and promotes overall health.

                <p class="text-2xl font-medium pr-14">Macronutrients are the primary nutrients required by the body in large amounts to provide energy and support growth, metabolism, and other bodily functions. They include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, each serving unique roles. Carbohydrates provide quick energy, proteins help in muscle repair and growth, and fats support cell function and hormone production. Proper balance of macronutrients is essential for maintaining health, performance, and well-being.
